A Terraria mod created by @LackOfName.
Focus on minimal sprites but beautiful graphics.
Mostly just stuff I always wanted a mod to exist for.

TODO Now:
-Seperate TemporalMissile and TemporalSubMissle into seperate .cs files in \Projectiles (From TemporalPlayer.cs)


Known Bugs:
TBD

Future Balance Changes:
-More velocity for temporal Launcher [x]
-Various crafting changes []
