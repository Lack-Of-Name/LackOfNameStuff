A Terraria mod created by @LackOfName.
Focus on minimal sprites but beautiful graphics.
Mostly just stuff I always wanted a mod to exist for.

TODO/Future Plans:
-More items using time shard material
-Weapon for summoner & Melee
-weapons for later-game Calamity Mod (Detect if present)
-Weapons for pre-hardmode
-Upgrade for dirt rod

This Release:
-An actual ranged weapon
-Fix time shard drop rate
-Fix time shard glow colour
-Time Shard armour set
