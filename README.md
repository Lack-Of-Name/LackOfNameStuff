A Terraria mod created by @LackOfName.
Focus on minimal sprites but beautiful graphics.
Mostly just stuff I always wanted a mod to exist for.

TODO/Future Plans:
-More items using time shard material
-Armour set using time shards
-Weapon for summoner & Melee
-weapons for later-game Calamity Mod (Detect if present)
-Weapons for pre-hardmode
-Upgrade for dirt rod
